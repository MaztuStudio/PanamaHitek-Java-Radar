# PanamaHitek-Java-Radar
A radar arduino app using an ultrasonic sensor with a servo

## Project Uses

  - PanamaHitek Library
  - C++ For .ino files
  - Java

## The Why's

This was a final proyect for an arduino class, the idea was to make a radar using an arduino, ultrasonic sensor and a servomotor || See Pic Below ||

The code recieves a number from the ultrasonic sensor that detects an object from a meter away, the range of said object will be portrayed in a window where you can see where the sensor is detecting an object, this is then logged on a text file

### Where and why
The main file is in the 'test' folder, named mover.java, the arduino file is in the same folder named ultrasonic_sensor.ino

The folder "main" has all the files of the library panama hitek
